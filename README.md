# [Project 2: Development of Prediction Models to Detect the Presence of MGMT Promoter Methylation for Prognosis of Brain Tumor](https://github.com/Muskr39/MGMTp.git)
* Created a tool that classifies MGMTp methylation status for the prognosis of brain tumor.
* Applied Several Image pre-processing techniques
* Utilized ResNet50 and EfficientNetV2 and evaluated the performance of each model. 
* Built a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using gradio of the Best Model

# [Project 1: Non-invasive Continous Glucose Monitoring](https://github.com/Muskr39/Gluco.git)
* Developed a Device that measures glucose continuously and non-invasively.
* Build A Portable smartwatch device using ESP32 TTGO T-Display
* Utilized Random Forest regressor for the prediction.
